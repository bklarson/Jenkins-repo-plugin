[[RepoPlugin-Description]]
== Description

This plugin adds Repo (https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo) as an SCM
provider for Jenkins. Projects can use this plugin to only run builds
when changes are detected in any of the git repositories in the repo
manifest, to list the changes between builds, and to re-create the
project state across all repositories for any previous build using a
static manifest.

[[RepoPlugin-Pipelines]]
== Pipelines

The repo plugin provides an SCM implementation to be used with the Pipeline SCM link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-scm-step/[`checkout` step].

The link:https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/pipeline-snippet-generator[Pipeline Syntax Snippet Generator] guides the user to select checkout options.

[[RepoPlugin-EnvironmentVariables]]
=== Environment Variables

The repo plugin assigns values to environment variables in Pipeline projects.

REPO_MANIFEST_URL:: URL of manifest repository used.
REPO_MANIFEST_BRANCH:: Branch of the manifest repository used.
REPO_MANIFEST_FILE:: Manifest filename used.
REPO_MANIFEST_XML:: Static manifest (in XML format).

[[RepoPlugin-Version1.2]]
=== Version 1.2

If build scripts modify the workspace, which cause problems during repo
sync, try running git reset --hard on the repository and re-running repo
sync. Thanks to https://github.com/tgover1[tgover].

Don't show all the changes brought in from a merge commit in the change
log, just show the merge commit (see git log --first-parent). This fixes
a problem of a merge commit breaking the build and all authors of
changes brought in with that merge commit getting emailed about it.
Thanks to https://github.com/tgover1[tgover].

[[RepoPlugin-Version1.1]]
=== Version 1.1

Add support for syncing from local mirrors, specify the number of
projects to sync simultaneously, use a local manifest, and sync to a
subdirectory of the workspace. Thanks to
https://github.com/tgover1[tgover].

Add support to specify the name of the manifest file to use. Thanks to
https://github.com/farshidce[farshidce].
