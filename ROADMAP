Future features roadmap
=======================

Roughly in order of priority.  I have no solid plans to work on any of these,
but if you'd like to make any contributions, this list is a good place to
start!

Investigate usage of ToolInstaller
    Automagically fetch repo from a URL, put it in the workspace and
		put that dir in the PATH for the current build. Such that it is
		not necessary to install repo manually on all your slaves.

Wipe workspace option? (Follow git plugin here)
Badge/Tag support

Gerrit-Download integration (Gerrit Trigger plugin support)
Better auto-retry logic

Support smartsync (-s option)
