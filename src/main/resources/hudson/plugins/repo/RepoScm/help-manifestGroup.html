  <p>
    Restricts manifest projects to ones tagged with provided group name. This is passed to repo as
    <code>repo init -g <i>groupName</i></code>. If a group name is not provided, the <code>-g</code>
    option is not passed to repo and it will default to fetching projects that are tagged with 'default'.
